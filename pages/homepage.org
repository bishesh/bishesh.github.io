* Interests

- Medical Imaging Informatics and Computational Biomedicine (MIICB) to improve healthcare, medicine and the understanding of biology
- Identifying and working on research problems that are relevant to lower income countries in the field of MIICB
- Strengthening research capacity and engagement of LICs in Artificial Intelligence

** Nepal Related
- Strengthening scientific research capabilities of Nepal.
- Co-founder of a (very new, details coming soon) research institute in Nepal with the core expertise in computational sciences and AI, and focusing on solving global problems in the field of healthcare, agriculture, climate change, governance and social science.

I am trying to collect some resources useful for like minded Nepalese interested in doing research in/for Nepal.
These resources can be found at [[https://abhinavnepal.github.io/Science-innovation-Nepal/][Science Innovation Nepal]].

# I have a special interest in working under the models that increase independent research capabilities of Low Income Countries, taking Nepal as an example where I would like to be based upon.
# Durable solutions of the problems faced by developing nations cannot be achieved by working under a model where the developing nations are the  "consumers" of the ready-made solutions and technologies "produced" by the developed nations. 
# Building research capabilities of such countries allows:

# - Creation of novel ideas coming from the first hand experience of the problems.
# - More uniform development across the globe and the reduction of the global digital divide problem.
# - Diversifying the scientifc community which adds value to the global human knowledge and advancement.

# ** Research Institute of Informatics and Applied Mathematics in Nepal
# I, along with some other Nepali friends have been slowly working towards a plan of building, a world class research institute of informatics and applied mathematics in Nepal with an objective of playing a key role in the development of Nepal, and also contribute towards solving global problems of the world in the field of healthcare, agriculture, climate change and social science.
