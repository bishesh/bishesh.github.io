# I have a special interest in working under the models that increase independent research capabilities of Low Income Countries, taking Nepal as an example where I would like to be based upon.
# Durable solutions of the problems faced by developing nations cannot be achieved by working under a model where the developing nations are the  "consumers" of the ready-made solutions and technologies "produced" by the developed nations. 
# Building research capabilities of such countries allows:

# - Creation of novel ideas coming from the first hand experience of the problems.
# - More uniform development across the globe and the reduction of the global digital divide problem.
# - Diversifying the scientifc community which adds value to the global human knowledge and advancement.

# ** Research Institute of Informatics and Applied Mathematics in Nepal
# I, along with some other Nepali friends have been slowly working towards a plan of building, a world class research institute of informatics and applied mathematics in Nepal with an objective of playing a key role in the development of Nepal, and also contribute towards solving global problems of the world in the field of healthcare, agriculture, climate change and social science.
